# Data-minning-ID3-Tree
An implementation of ML simple ID3 tree
the algorithm uses 5 classess prediction, and Information Gain (Enthropy)
a basic understanding of ML is nneded, in order to use this tour.
This example uses a very simple dataset(Q1_1.csv), so it can be helpfull to have a close look at the algorithm.
In the real world there is no need to drill down so much, especially when dealing with bigger data projects, we are usually dealing with API's and ML libraries.
Yet, this tuturial gives a tool for a better understanding the inner proccess of building a decision tree.
